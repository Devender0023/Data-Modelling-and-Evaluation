# Data-Modelling-and-Evaluation
Data Science Project to predict the Death Event of heart-patients

Introduction

The investigation's major purpose is to discover the association between a range of parameters and the survival rate of patients with heart failure difficulties, as well as which of these factors has the most impact on the survival rate. As a result, it is critical to employ the data science process, which includes establishing a research aim for the inquiry, preparing and exploring the data using data curation, and presenting the data in a meaningful way utilizing various data modeling techniques and models.


Methodology
The first stage in the approach is to prepare and clean the provided dataset to ensure that it is free of flaws such as logical errors or data entry errors that could potentially affect the investigation, analysis, and report results. It is critical to grasp each part of the data collected separately in order to gain an understanding of the factors I was analyzing and how they could effectively contribute to the inquiry done in this report. The first step of the technique explores each attribute from the acquired information individually and represents it using the suitable descriptive visualisation.

Furthermore, multiple feasible hypotheses are developed in order to meet the goal of this study, and the links between various pairs of features are studied and displayed utilizing proper visualisation. I can obtain a comprehensive understanding of the factors that most influence the survival rate of patients with heart failure by analyzing the correlations between several factors.

Based on the study objective of this report, I can determine that the problem I was attempting to analyze is a classification problem, and I need to observe how various characteristics will effect the survival rate of the patient represented as a death event in the dataset. As a result, in order to better understand the impact of these specific characteristics, I opted to utilize the K-Nearest Neighbour model and the Decision Tree based on the associations I selected as most relevant in my hypothesis in the data exploration phase.
