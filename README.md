# Data-Modelling-and-Evaluation
Data Science Project to predict the Death Event of heart-patients

Introduction

In this assignment, we have been given several datasets to use to analyse and model using data modelling techniques. As a team, we have chosen to analyse the Heart Failure dataset. The main goal of our investigation is to determine the relationship between a variety of factors on the survival rate of patients with heart failure problems and which of these factors have the most significant impact on the survival rate. Therefore, it is crucial to use the data science process which involves setting up a research goal for our investigation, prepare and explore the data using data curation, use various data modelling techniques and models to present the data in a meaningful way. For the purpose of the requirements of this assignment, the main focus is data preparation, data exploring and data modelling.


Methodology

The first step in the methodology is to prepare and clean the given dataset to ensure that it free from any errors such as logical errors or data entry errors that could potentially affect the investigation, the analysis and results in the report. It is crucial to understand each aspect of the data collected individually to obtain an insight into the factors we are analysing and how they could contribute effectively to the investigation undertaken in this report. In the first section of the method, each attribute from the information collected is explored independently and represented using the appropriate descriptive visualisation.
Furthermore, to achieve the aim of this report, several plausible hypotheses are set, and the relationships between various pairs of attributes are examined and presented using appropriate visualisation. By investigating the relationships between multiple factors, we can gain a clear insight into the factors that most impact the survival rate of patients with heart failure.
Based on the research goal of this report, we can identify that the problem we are trying to analyse is a classification problem and we need to observe how specific factors will impact the survival rate of the patient represented as death event in the dataset. Therefore, to better understand the impact of these specific factors, we decided to use the K-Nearest Neighbour model and the Decision Tree based on the relationships we identified as the most relevant in our hypotheses in the data exploration section.
